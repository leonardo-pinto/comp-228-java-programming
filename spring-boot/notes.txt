** What is Spring Container? **

Spring Container manages Spring Beans and their life cycle
1. Bean Factory: Basic Spring Container
2. ** Application Context: Advanced Spring Container with enterprise-specific features
	a. Easy to use in web applications
	b. Easy internationalization
	c. Easy integration with Spring AOP

** Java Bean vs Spring Bean **
- POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
	No constraints
	Any Java object is a POJO
- Java Bean (EJB)
	Should have a public default constructor
	Should have Getters and Setters
	Should implement Serializable interface
- Spring Bean
	Anything that is managed by Spring framework
	Spring uses IOC Container (Bean Factory or ApplicationContext) to manage these objects
	
** How can I list all Spring Beans? **
	for (String bean:context.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
            System.out.println(bean);
        }
		
** What if multiples matching beans available? **
	Set Bean and Primary or add Qualifier
